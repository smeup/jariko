 * For example suppose to have a data class `MyNode` that extends `Node` and which has two property `thenBody` and `elseBody`, both
 * collection of nodes.
 * Suppose that you introduce a third computed property `body` which joins thenBody` and `elseBody`.
 * If you call `myNode.process({yourOperation})` yourOperation will be called foreach node two times, first af all, for all nodes in
 * `thenBody`, than for all nodes in `elseBody`, and finally for all nodes in `body`.
 * To face this issue, you will annotate `body`
