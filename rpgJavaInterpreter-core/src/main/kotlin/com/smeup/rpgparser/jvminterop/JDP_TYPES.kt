  JDP_TYPES - Java Doped Procedure
  A sample of a 'doped' procedure, acting like an RPG-procedure
  but its implementation is done in kotlin and not in rpgle."
  Procedure is called by 'CALLP' and or 'EVAL' rpgle statement.
  This procedure is called by a test passing wrong type parameters:
  Expected two parameters 'String,Number' but called with 'Number,Number',
  so an exception will be thrown.
